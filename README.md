Use the sql script to create and populate the database.
The database used is MySQL.

The Database was tested with WAMP and MySQL Workbench 6.3 CE

For the Exercise, the Master Branch and the Development Branch are at the same state

Thanks to create a MySQL profile with "onemars" as login and "onemars" as password.

Yes, it's not very safe, but it's just a study project ;)
